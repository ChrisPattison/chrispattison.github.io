Hi! I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Quantum Pod at the [Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing](https://simons.berkeley.edu/). I am primarily interested in practical and theoretical aspects of quantum fault-tolerance including quantum computer architecture and applications to quantum computational complexity theory.
